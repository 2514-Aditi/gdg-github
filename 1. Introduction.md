# Getting Started

Welcome to the Git and GitHub course!  

In 2005, a software engineer named **Linus Torvalds** had a problem while making the Linux Kernel. With so many versions of code in so many files that were difficult to keep track of, he created **Git**, a version control system that tracks changes to your code.  

A few years later, the web platform **GitHub** came along, creating the "Google Drive for code," founded by **Tom Preston-Werner**, **Chris Wanstrath**, and **PJ Hyett**. It is now how we store and share code online!  

Here we will learn how Git and GitHub come together to make sharing your code easier and keeping track of changes a breeze using Git commands.

## Checking if Git is Installed 

1. Open the **Terminal** on Mac or the **Command Prompt** on Windows.  
2. Type the following command and press Enter:  

   ```bash
   git --version 

3.  If Git is installed, you should see a version number, such as:

    ```bash
    git version 2.39.3

## Install Git

To install Git, you can use command line or you can visit official website and download the installer for your operating system. Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux and is available at https://git-scm.com/downloads.
